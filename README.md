# Real-Time Strain Gauge  Signal Acquisition System for Biomimetic Robotics 
The Agile and Adaptive Robotics Lab (AARL) at Portland State University is developing biomimetic robots that utilize braided pneumatic actuators (BPAs) to mimic animal locomotion. The existing challenge our team aims to address within robotics research is the inability to accurately measure the changing length of these actuators in real-time, which is necessary for effective feedback control. In order to address this issue, the AARL has worked with technology partner Liquid Wire to integrate highly deformable strain gauge sensors directly into the artificial muscles of their quadruped robot. Our ECE senior capstone project focuses on designing and building the electrical signal acquisition system required to interface these flexible sensors with the quadruped’s existing control hardware.

Our team will deliver a robust, modular sensing system capable of reading and processing data from up to 24 of the flexible Liquid Wire sensors simultaneously. Utilizing a Teensy microcontroller architecture, our system will digitize the analog strain data and apply signal filtering in order to minimize the noise and cross-interference inherent in robotics applications of this nature. We will employ an iterative prototyping approach to ensure the final product achieves a sampling rate of 50-100 Hz, providing the reliable and low-latency feedback required for dynamic locomotion control driven by the neural networks in development at the AARL.
